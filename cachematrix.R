## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation 
## and there may be some benefit to caching the 
## inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## The assignment is to write a pair of functions
## that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## A given prototype of makeCacheMatrix is modified
## to cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
    getInverse <- function() inv
    list(set = set,
         get = get,
         setInverse = setInverse,
         getInverse = getInverse)

}


## cacheSolve function is developed if a matrix is changed the 
## inverse of the matrix is computed,
##  otherwise it is extracted from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getInverse()
    if (!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    mat <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(mat, ...)
    x$setInverse(inv)
